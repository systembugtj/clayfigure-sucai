# Fan Art
In the United States, selling paintings or fan art featuring copyrighted characters, such as anime characters, falls under copyright law. Here are the key points to consider:

Copyright Law

1. Original Work Protection: Copyright law protects original works of authorship, including visual art, literature, and characters. This means that characters from anime are protected by copyright, and their creators have exclusive rights to their use and distribution.

Fair Use Doctrine

1. Fair Use: Some uses of copyrighted material may be considered fair use, which allows limited use without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, selling fan art is generally not considered fair use because it is commercial and not transformative enough to fall under this category.

Licensing and Permissions

1. Licensing: To legally sell paintings or fan art of copyrighted characters, you need to obtain permission or a license from the copyright holder. This usually involves negotiating terms and possibly paying a licensing fee.

Risks and Consequences

1. Legal Risks: Selling fan art without permission can result in legal action from the copyright holder, including cease and desist orders, fines, and lawsuits for copyright infringement.

Fan Art Policies

1. Fan Art Policies: Some companies have specific policies regarding fan art. For instance, they might allow non-commercial use but prohibit commercial sales, or they may allow limited sales under certain conditions. It is essential to check the specific policies of the anime or character's copyright holder.

Enforcement

1. Enforcement: While not all copyright holders actively pursue small-scale infringement, there is always a risk. Larger sales or gaining significant attention can increase the likelihood of enforcement actions.

Best Practices

- Create Original Characters: Instead of using copyrighted characters, create original characters or designs inspired by them.
- Seek Permission: If you plan to sell fan art, consider contacting the copyright holder to seek permission or a licensing agreement.
- Understand Fair Use: Familiarize yourself with the fair use doctrine and how it applies to your work to avoid unintentional infringement.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can navigate the complexities of copyright law while pursuing your artistic endeavors.
